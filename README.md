## üí° Challenge

This challenge consists of implementing the behavior similar to the 'paint bucket tool' of MS-Paint. The program should
hold an array of symbols and characters representing the shape of an image. With each array value representing a pixel
in that image. Each pixel should have a color and, identical characters or symbols would represent the same color. For
example: The following 4x6 matrix represents the image of the letter 'P', collered by '#', having the background color
of '.'.

```bash
.###..
.#..#.
.###..
.#....
```

The program should recieve one pixel (from that image), a new color, and then be able to paint the correct adjacent
region filled with that same pixel's color, exactly like the 'paint bucket tool' of MS-Paint does.

Examples:<br>
Pixel (0, 1) and new color 'o':

```bash
# Previously:
.###..
.#..#.
.###..
.#....

# Afterwards:
.ooo..
.o..#.
.ooo..
.o....
```

Pixel (1,3) and new color 'o':

```bash
# Previously:
.###.
.#..#.
.###.
.#....

# Afterwards:
.###..
.#oo#.
.###..
.#....
```

Pixel (1,3) and new color '#':

```bash
# Previously:
.###..
.#..#.
.###..
.#....

# Afterwards:
.###..
.####.
.###..
.#....
```
